# designing-probe-set-for-Araneoidea
contain some little script
Here contain the data and simple script which used in the manuscript.

But I INCORRECTLY put the incorrect protocol of probe set designing into manuscript.
the problem is about incorrectly descript how to build the probe set,
this do not influence the results of _in silico_ test,
if you need to re-do this probe set, please wait for me to upadate correctly data and protocol.
thnak you.
